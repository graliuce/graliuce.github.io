Hi I'm Grace. I'm a first-year PhD student in the MLD department at CMU. I'm interested in reinforcement learning and computational cognition applied to sustainability and societal decision making. I am very grateful to have been advised by [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php), [Rachit Dubey](https://rachit-dubey.github.io/), [Benjamin Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/), and [Gabe Vecchi](https://vecchi.princeton.edu/people/gabriel-vecchi) during my undergrad and Master's at Princeton. I am also fortunate to be supported by the NSF GRFP fellowship.
